# Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they keep the project focused, readable, and safe for ConfigMgr Task Sequence use.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Install the pinned development modules and run `.\build\Invoke-Validation.ps1` in Windows PowerShell 5.1 as described in [validation](docs/validation.md).
2. Keep examples generalized.
3. Do not add organization-specific defaults.
4. Do not introduce credential logging.
5. Update documentation when behavior changes.
6. Add focused Pester coverage for behavioral fixes, and distinguish mocks from live tests.
7. Regenerate `CHECKSUMS.txt` after all file changes, including documentation and workflow updates, following the [checkout convention](docs/release-process.md#checksum-checkout-convention). Run validation again before pushing.

Use `-SkipChecksums` only during the developer loop while source edits await manifest regeneration. Final validation must run without that switch.

The production script must remain self-contained, target Windows PowerShell 5.1, and retain secure defaults. Review analyzer warnings individually; any suppression needs a precise justification. Never include credentials or unsanitized logs in a pull request.

Record live environment results separately from mocked tests. Do not represent the pre-release 1.0.0 candidate as a published or live-certified release.
